      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        My name is KJ. I was born and raised in WA state but relocated to Oregon
        to be with my wife just over half a decade ago. When I'm not enjoying
        family time with my wife and various pets, I can be found partaking in
        one of my many hobbies. From video games to wood carving, I've yet to
        find a hobby I haven't liked!

      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>
        Most of my career experience since the pandemic has been in social work,
        but over the last six months I've been working on a graphic design
        portfolio and small coding projects. My pride and joy right now is a
        'Whale Translator' that I programmed myself from scratch!
